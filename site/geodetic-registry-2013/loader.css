/* DUPLICATION
 *
 * For consistency with the main app view and to avoid font/layout flashes,
 * some basic rules are duplicated from our main UI framework.
 *
 * We could extract them automaticaly, but thatâ€™s undeserved hassle and too error prone.
 *
 * NOTE: Duplicate as few as possible for the abovementioned purposes only.
